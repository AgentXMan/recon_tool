# Directory Discovery Information

This project involves the use of two different files for directory enumeration.

## Files Used

1. **directories.txt**  
   - Source: `Discovery/Web-Content/combined_directories.txt`
   - This file is used for comprehensive directory discovery.

2. **directories_fallback.txt**  
   - Source: `Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-1.0.txt`
   - This file serves as a fallback for discovering additional directories when needed.

Both files are used in web content discovery, especially useful in penetration testing and security assessments to find hidden directories.

## Usage
Ensure that both files are placed in the appropriate directory before running the directory discovery tools.
