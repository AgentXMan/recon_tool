# Subdomain Discovery Information

This project involves the use of two different files for subdomain enumeration.

## Files Used

1. **subdomain.txt**  
   - Source: `Discovery/DNS/n0kovo_subdomains.txt`
   - This file is used for standard subdomain discovery.

2. **subdomains_fallback.txt**  
   - Source: `Discovery/DNS/bug-bounty-program-subdomains-trickest-inventory.txt`
   - This file acts as a fallback for discovering additional subdomains.

Both files are sourced from trusted repositories for subdomain enumeration and discovery, utilized in various bug bounty programs and security assessments.

## Usage
Ensure that both files are placed in the appropriate directory before running the subdomain discovery tools.
